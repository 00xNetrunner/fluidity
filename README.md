One browser startpage I created

If you have any problems or miss a feature, create an issue and I will take a look at it :)

I will append this page soon.

## Usage
The startpage is expecting to be hosted at {host}/startpage.
If you want to use it, you have 2 options:

* You could just use [my hosted](https://prettycoffee.github.io/startpage/) version.

* If you want your own copy, head to the `/static/js/runtime-main.ae06b328.js` file and search for `/startpage/`. Replace it with `./` and you should be fine :)
